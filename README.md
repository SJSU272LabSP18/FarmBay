Our aim is to make the lives of millions of farmers easier by helping them make criticial decisions about the type of crops best suited for their fields with respect to maximum monetary gains and at the same time giving them an online market place where they can easily sell off their produce based on an auction framework. This will not only help farmers but also wholesale buyers of crops and give them access to more options thus creating a better interconected network for business. 

To acieve the first objective, we implement Machine Learning and Predictive Data Modeling on the dataset collected for the previous years for all the crops from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) arm of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Data is refined as per requirement so that it gives a list of best suited crops in descending order for the farmer based on key input parameters namely Zip Code, State, Farming Area, Time Duration, Amount Invested and Expected Returns. Using the suggestion from the Machine Learning algorithm, the farmer can make a well informed decision about the crop he's most likely to receive maximum profits from.

The second objective involves giving the farmer the ability to list his crop on an online market place and place a minimum value of his produce as per his calculations. That is the minimum bid at which the farmer can make the sale. Once the crop is placed on the market place, a buyer anywhere in the nation will be able to see the listed crop and place a bid accordingly. Firebase Database instance is used to store the crop data for all farmers and the consequent bidding process. Blockchain is implemented to approve the transactions in real time and make the entire process as seamless as possible.

The inspiration behind this project is to create something to serve the farmers who even after putting in so much effort into their fields end up losing huge sums of money becasue of insufficient information. We believe in serving and creating a better community and improving the lives of people by doing our part in the bigger scheme of things.
