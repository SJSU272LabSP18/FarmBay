Project Options:

1- Title: Products Info Feature Built for Customers

Description: When a customer, who is new to the store and the products, enters the desired product into the system, it returns the product consumption sales plus the product popularity based on the most recent number of weekly/monthly purchases. The traditional system only provides the customer review information without specifiying any number or the ranking/standing against other similar products outside.

2- Title: Smart Harvesting Mobile App

Description: When a amateur farmer wants to increase his crop profit, he uses this app to input certain crop-related parameters (location, budget, weather, history, geography, water resoures, etc), and the app outputs certain potential crops that the farmer could harvest with maximum profit. It also outputs any necessary chemical substances that the farmer should use.
